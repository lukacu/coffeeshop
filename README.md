About the CoffeeShop project
============================

Coffeeshop is a conglomerate of handy general purpose Java classes. The classes are divided into several packages with clearly defined dependences. CoffeeShop is a self contained library - no other external libraries are required (apart from the Java SE platform of course).

The goal of the CoffeeShop library is to ease the development of a small to medium size Java application.
